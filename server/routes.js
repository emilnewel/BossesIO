In battle, he can use his Super Arm to throw heavy objects, such as boulders and blocks, at his enemies.

As his namesake he loves participating in activities revolving around snow, like snowball fights.

        description: 'Bomb Man\'s personality depicts him to be that of a teenager (possibly a nod to his mohawk). He enjoys fighting and is an expert in demolitions, being able to quickly create and throw Hyper Bombs with startling accuracy, capable of destroying most targets with ease. However, he also enjoys firework displays, festivals, and ten-pin bowling. He is also a daredevil and his attitude depicts it, but he can be a bit wasteful on money and his bombs and has a dislike for a match or lighter, possibly a relation to his weakness, the Fire Storm. Bomb Man is a playable character in both Mega Man Powered Up and Mega Man\'s Soccer.',

In his spare time, he has taken up playing the electric guitar while singing. Fitting for his motif, he also despises products made of rubber.',

Bubble Man can utilise the bubbles for several different purposes, including hitting opponents with bursts of small bubbles and blowing larger and more durable bubbles to either wrap opponents inside to trap them temporarily, or for Bubble Man himself to hide in as a shield.',

To his enemies, Flash Man appears to be moving at light speed or teleporting. It is believed that this ability is a perfected form of what the later-introduced Time Man was capable of- because unlike Time Man, who could only slow down time with Time Slow, Flash Man can stop it completely.',

Directly relating to his skill with throwing his Blades, he enjoys playing with Frisbees in his spare time, but dislikes it when dogs get in his way by catching them. When Dr. Light saw Metal Man for the first time, he remarked that he was "the dentist of the future".',
